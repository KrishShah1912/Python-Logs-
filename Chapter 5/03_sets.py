x = () # it will create empty set ........but don't use x = {} it will create empty dictionary

s = {1,4,5,67,13,5,678,5} # it will not maintain order, if want to maintain order then use list

# sets are unindexed it won't allow you to access through index value

print (s) # here it will print 1,4,67,,5,678,13 it won't repeat value
